# Exploring Robustness of GNN against Universal Injection Attack from a Worst-case Perspective

A PyTorch implementation of "Exploring Robustness of GNN against Universal Injection Attack from a Worst-case Perspective" (CIKM 2024).

## Introduction
We propose a method named **CERT_UIA** to enhance the robustness of GNN models against worst-case attacks, specifically targeting the scenario of **U**niversal node **I**njection **A**ttacks (UIA), thereby filling a gap in the existing literature on certified robustness in this context. Our approach involves a two-stage attack process that replaces the transformations of the topology and feature spaces with equivalent unified feature transformations, unifying the optimization of worst-case perturbations into a single feature space.
